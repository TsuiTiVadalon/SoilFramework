Create a subclass of SoilControl. In it you will have:
	*The constructor where you would initialize all your stuff
	execution_started_response();
	soil_signal_response(...);
	sdl_event_response(...);

Create an instance of SoilEngine in the SoilControl object.
The event loop will run in SoilEngine::execute()

Make the UI by creating a SoilLayout and set it as main layout of the SoilEngine object:

Add the elements to the layout using SoilLayout::add_elm()

Activate the event that will trigger your function using:

SoilEngine::activate_soil_signal(SoilUIElm* elm,SOIL_SIGNAL signal, int response);
SoilEngine::activate_sdl_event(SDL_EventType event_type, int response);

The ones supposed to be UI elements inherit from SoilWidget or SoilLayout and both inherit from SoilUIElm
